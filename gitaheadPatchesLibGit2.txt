# blame: fix update from buffer
remote: add callbacks for connect/disconnect
- implemented into gittyup branch of libgit2

# hash: changed git_repository_hashfile to hash symlinks the same as when they are added to the index

# submodule: pass absolute path to clone
The init callback worked because it uses the parent repo path to contruct
distinct repo and working directories, but the tests for an existing empty
directory in git_clone were relative to the current working directory
instead of the parent repository directory.

# submodule: changed git_submodule_status to take a submodule instead of a repo and name
- not needed anymore!


# patch: add context lines accessor
- implemented into gittyup branch of libgit2

# patch: add owner accessor
- already upstream


# patch: added flag to disable mmap
- really needed?

# push: fixed several update callback issues
# Update callback is no longer called (and the reference isn't updated) when the
# local and remote oids already match. The update callback is now called for tags.
# Finally, fixed a leak when there are multiple refspecs.


# diff: initialize git_diff_options.context_lines to an invalid default value and read 'diff.context' when the value is invalid

# checkout: notify for deleted files
- implemented into gittyup branch of libgit2

# blame: disable rename detection
- really needed?

# blame: add blame progress callback
- implemented into gittyup branch of libgit2

# fetch: work around failure to fetch annotated tags added to existing commits
- implemented into gittyup branch of libgit2
